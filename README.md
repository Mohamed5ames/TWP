# AWS Solution With Terraform
# Description
This repository hosts Terraform configuration files for deploying AWS infrastructure across various regions. The project is structured into modules to handle distinct resources, with separate directories for individual projects deployed across different AWS regions,
Within this Terraform project, infrastructure is provisioned in two AWS regions: Project 1 and Project 2. It encompasses modules for deploying EC2 instances, DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, VPCs, and subnets. The latest commit introduces VPC endpoints to improve security and connectivity.
